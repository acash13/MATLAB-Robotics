# MATLAB-Robotics

A collection of robotics-related projects and algorithms implemented primarily in MATLAB, with some Python integration. This repository showcases work in areas like kinematics, path planning, and game-based robotics applications.

## Features
- **DH Parameters and Optimization**: Tools for modeling robot arms using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.
- **Path Planning**: Algorithms for efficient navigation.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A strategic AI-based game implementation.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB (Primary)
- Python (Supporting scripts)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acash13/MATLAB-Robotics.git
   
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.

3. Run the desired scripts (e.g., DH optimization, path planning, or Tic-Tac-Toe).

## Requirements
-MATLAB (recommended version: R2021a or later)
-(Optional) Python 3.x for Python scripts
