MATLAB-Robotics
A collection of robotics-related projects and algorithms implemented primarily in MATLAB, with some Python integration. This repository showcases work in areas like kinematics, path planning, and game-based robotics applications.

Features
DH Parameters and Optimization: Tools for working with Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, a standard method for robot modeling.

Path Planning: Algorithms for navigating spaces efficiently, crucial for autonomous robots.

Tic-Tac-Toe: A fun, strategic implementation demonstrating AI techniques in game playing.

Technologies Used
MATLAB (Primary language)

Python (Supporting scripts)

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/acash13/MATLAB-Robotics.git
Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned folder.

Run the individual scripts depending on your interest (e.g., DH parameter optimization, path planning, or Tic-Tac-Toe).

Requirements
MATLAB (recommended version: R2021a or later)

(Optional) Python 3.x installed for any Python-based utilities.
